## Idea

What principle are you using to measure a "good" cluster?  
Why does this make sense?
How would this be tuned - that is, what resampling does it need?
Does this apply in general, or only for a particular type of clustering algorithm?
Link any references that might help support this.

## Metric Calculation

Write a function here that calculates your "tuning metric" for a particular value of k.

## Experiments

On either simluated data or real data with known structure, run several replications of your experiment for each of various k's.  Make sure to set a seed.

## Results

What did your experiments show?  Why do you think this happened? Is there anything promising here?
